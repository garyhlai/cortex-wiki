# Cortex Overview
## What is Cortex?
Cortex is the first ever blockchain technology that allows the execution of AI algorithms on the blockchain. Cortex provides an AI platform for developers to upload their models on the blockchain and be incorporated into smart contracts. 

To put it in context, blockchain started with bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency. Then entered Ethereum, which allows programming on top of the blockchain, namely the smart contract. Now Cortex builds on Ethereum to enable AI-powered smart contract.

## How does Cortex compare to Ethereum?
Right now Ethereum runs on the CPU; therefore, one cannot run non-trivial AI models on Ethereum. Incorporating AI into an Ethereum Dapp would require off-chain solution which would compromise the integrity and security of the AI model and in a sense defeat the purpose of a smart contract. 

Cortex is built from the ground up to run on the GPU/FPGA. This allows AI models to execute directly on the blockchain, enabling true AI smart contract. In addition, the CVM is backward-compatible with the EVM, so Ethereum developers can easily migrate their applications onto to the Cortex blockchain.

## Why do we want to run AI model on the blockchain? Wouldn’t that be very expensive?
Running AI model on the blockchain ensures the integrity of the model. For example, let’s say a smart contract is programmed to give Amy 100 dollars if the facial recognition model recognizes the person as Amy. If the facial recognition model has to run off-chain, its security would be severely compromised: a hacker can change the model to recognize his own face and thereby steal the 100 dollars from the smart contract. On the other hand, if the execution of the facial recognition model happens on the blockchain, it would be very hard to hack the model.  

The transaction fee is extremely low if the network is not super busy. 
What does “Decentralized AI Autonomous Ecosystem” mean? How does Cortex decentralize AI?  

To understand this question, we need to first understand the infrastructure of the Cortex blockchain.

We offer a blockchain platform for AI developers to upload their models and for Dapp developers to easily integrate these models in their Dapps (without the hassle of dealing with different protocols of different AI model service providers). A helpful analogy is to think of Cortex as a decentralized eBay for machine learning model API calls, where the sellers are the AI model providers and the buyers are the Dapp developers. Via smart contracts, AI model provider gets a portion of the transaction fee whenever the model is inferred. 

This creates an ecosystem where individual AI developers, not just big corporations, are incentivized to upload their AI models to the blockchain, and Dapp developers have access to the best AI models in the world and have the freedom to choose between them. Hence the decentralization. The competition within the ecosystem between AI model providers will naturally lead to the evolution of better and better AI models. Hence the term “autonomous ecosystem.”

## Sometimes you use the word “AI” and sometimes you use the word “machine learning”, what is the relationship between these two terms?

Machine learning is a subfield of AI and by far the most promising one in helping achieve better artificial intelligence. The basic idea of machine learning is to train machines to certain perform tasks without explicitly programming them. In our marketing semantics and the machine learning communities in general, they have been used rather interchangeably. 


## How is Cortex different from other AI On Blockchain projects?
We are the only project that allows you to run AI programs on the blockchain realistically.
